## Usage

To dynamically get `max_allowance` of each level you should add it in the description of the level like this:
```html
<!--max_allowance=80-->
```
and instead of `80` you can set any number.


To use user API, call endpoint from this URI using GET method:

`URI/wp-content/plugins/tsm/api/user.php?username=USERNAME`
